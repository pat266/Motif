This is a test folder for the VibroScale paper and Github repository.

1. Cannot run the `main_paper_clean.py` because there are missing functions.

2. The 2 Jupyter Notebook files represent the the approach in the two python files appropriately. `main.ipynb` is the simplified version, and `main_paper_clean.ipynb` is the extended version that covers all tests.

3. The relative intensity and prediction in `main_paper_clean.ipynb` does not really work since they extract the zero load and fruit load from the same file every single time (which causes relative intensity to be 0 for all of them). Changes will be made in the code in the iOS app.
